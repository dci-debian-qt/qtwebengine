Description: Do not check for ICU data file
 quick hack to avoid checking for the nonexistent icudtl.dat and silence the
 resulting warnings - not upstreamable as is because it removes the fallback
 mechanism for the ICU data directory (which is not used in our builds because
 we use the system ICU, which embeds the data statically) completely
